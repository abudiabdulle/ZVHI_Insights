ZHVI Trend Analysis: Comprehensive Study of Minneapolis and the Midwest Region
Project Overview
This repository presents an in-depth analysis of Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) trends across time, with a specific focus on the city of Minneapolis and its comparison to the broader Midwest region. The project aims to identify housing market trends, including peak and trough values, and to understand the evolving dynamics of housing affordability and market performance in Minneapolis relative to its peers.

Research Goals
The project addresses the following objectives:

To analyze housing market trends over time and identify key insights from ZHVI data.
To compare the housing market of Minneapolis with the broader Midwest region, highlighting differences and commonalities.
To identify the peak and trough ZHVI values in both Minneapolis and the Midwest region.
To interpret housing affordability challenges, policy implications, and economic factors driving the trends.
To provide visual and data-driven insights for policymakers, investors, and homeowners.
Methodology
The analysis is structured as follows:

1. Data Preparation
The ZHVI dataset is loaded, cleaned, and preprocessed to ensure accurate and reliable analysis.
Minneapolis-specific data is filtered, while the Midwest data is aggregated for regional comparisons.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key statistics and time-series visualizations are generated for both Minneapolis and the Midwest.
Seasonal patterns, growth trends, and deviations are highlighted.
3. Comparative Analysis
Minneapolis and Midwest trends are compared using average ZHVI values over time.
Rates of change and relative differences are calculated.
4. Peak and Trough Analysis
The highest (peak) and lowest (trough) ZHVI values are identified for Minneapolis and the Midwest.
These values are visually annotated on time-series plots.
5. Result Interpretation
Findings are contextualized using socioeconomic, geographic, and policy-related factors.
Specific insights and actionable recommendations are drawn for stakeholders.
